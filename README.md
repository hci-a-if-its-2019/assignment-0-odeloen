In some section, we have a hardtime to read the words in the navbar because of those word blend in  with the background.

In login page, if the user mistype their email and password they will face a warning that tell them to upload their receipt for the purchase. JUST. FOR. A. MISTYPE.

In FAQ section, there is no indicator that those words is a dropdown. This will confuse the readers that needing the FAQ.
